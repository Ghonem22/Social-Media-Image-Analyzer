# Social-Media-Image-Analyzer
Detect information from social media images using image processing, computer vision, Amazon Rekognition, and deploying the system using Flask on AWS.  We extract information from the images like "the number of likes", "date the image was posted", "privacy", and "number of viewers" for a given image on social media platforms.
